Description:\n\nA simple yet challenging project, to predict the housing price based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to mainroad, etc. The dataset is small yet, it\u0027s complexity arises due to the fact that it has strong multicollinearity. Can you overcome these obstacles \u0026 build a decent predictive model?\n\n\n### Acknowledgement: \nHarrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. (1978) Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air. J. Environ.
